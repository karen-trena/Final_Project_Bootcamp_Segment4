PRESENTATION
Content 
✓ The presentation tells a cohesive story about their project, including the following: 
✓ Selected topic
✓ Reason why they selected their topic
✓ Description of their source of data
✓ Questions they hope to answer with the data
✓ Description of the data exploration phase of the project
✓ Description of the analysis phase of the project
✓ Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project 
✓ Result of analysis
✓ Recommendation for future analysis
✓ Anything the team would have done differently 

Slides
✓ Presentations are finalized in Google Slides. 
✓ Slides are primarily images or graphics (rather than primarily text)
✓ Images are clear, in high-definition, and directly illustrative of subject matter

Live Presentation 
✓ All team members present in equal proportions 
✓ The team demonstrates interactivity of dashboard in real time 
✓ The presentation falls within any time limits provided by instructor 
✓ Submission includes speaker notes, flashcards, or a video of the presentation rehearsal

GITHUB
Main Branch
✓ All code in the main branch is production-ready. 
✓ All code is clean, commented, easy to read, and adheres to a coding standard (e.g., PEP8) 

Main branch should include: 
✓ All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
✓ All code necessary to complete machine learning portion of project 
✓ Any images that have been created (at least three)
✓ Requirements.txt file

README.md must include:
✓ Cohesive, structured outline of the project (this may include images, but should be easy to follow and digest) 
✓ Link to dashboard (or link to video of dashboard demo)
✓ Link to Google Slides presentation
Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

Individual Branches 
✓ At least one branch for each team member
✓ Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the final segment (16 total commits per person)

MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
Team members submit the working code for their machine learning model, as well as the following: 
✓ Description of data preprocessing 
✓ Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the team's decision-making process 
✓ Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
✓ Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
✓ Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)
✓ Description of how model was trained (or retrained, if they are using an existing model)
✓ Description and explanation of model’s confusion matrix, including final accuracy score 
Additionally, the model obviously addresses the question or problem the team is solving. 
Note: If statistical analysis is not included as part of the current analysis, include a description of how it would be included in the next phases of the project.

DATABASE
Team members present a final project with a fully integrated database.
✓ Database stores static data for use during the project
✓ Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database, or database connects to the model)
✓ Includes at least two tables (or collections, if using MongoDB)
✓ Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas) 
✓ Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)
Note: If you use a SQL database, you must provide your ERD with relationships.

DASHBOARD
The dashboard presents a data story that is logical and easy to follow for someone unfamiliar with the topic. It includes all of the following:
✓ Images from the initial analysis
✓ Data (images or report) from the machine learning task
✓ At least one interactive element 
Either the dashboard is published or the submission includes a screen capture video of it in action.
